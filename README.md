# Hi there! I am Kanishk 👋

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a neuroscientist(PhD student) turned **Data Scientist**. I turn complex data into clear, actionable insights that drive real impact. With a keen eye for patterns and a strategic mindset, I transform raw information into meaningful solutions that help businesses make smarter decisions.

I recently completed a hands-on intensive **Data Science and AI Bootcamp at Le Wagon Amsterdam**, where I honed my skills in data analysis, machine learning, MLOps, and Data Engineering.
